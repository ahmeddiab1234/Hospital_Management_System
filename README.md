# Hospital Management System üè•

A Python-based hospital management system to manage patients, specializations, and patient queues efficiently.


## Overview
This Python program is a **Hospital Management System** designed to help manage patient queues across 20 specializations. It allows adding patients with different urgency levels, retrieving the next patient, removing patients, and viewing all patients in the system.

## Features
- **Add a Patient**: Add a new patient to a specific specialization with a status (Normal, Urgent, or Super Urgent).
- **Print All Patients**: View all patients across all specializations.
- **Get Next Patient**: Retrieve and remove the next patient from a specific specialization.
- **Remove a Patient**: Remove a specific patient from a specialization.

## How It Works
The system is divided into three main components:
1. **FrontEnd**: Handles user interaction, displaying menus, and collecting input.
2. **BackEnd**: Manages the data, including patient queues and specializations.
3. **HospitalManager**: Acts as the bridge between the FrontEnd and BackEnd, orchestrating the flow of the program.
